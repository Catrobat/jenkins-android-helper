The Debian Package jenkins-android-helper
----------------------------

This package contains scripts to use Android Emulator with
Jenkins-Pipeline. As current Android-Emulator-Plugin for
Jenkins does not support Pipelines due to the lack of Jenkins
running processes in background.

The scripts try to provide a workaround. By following three rules,
the helpers can be used in a pipeline:
  - An AVD needs to be created per build BEFORE any subsequent call to those scripts.
  - The starting of the emulator needs to be executed in a parallel task (because it blocks)
  - In the end it needs to be made sure, that the kill functionality is run.
